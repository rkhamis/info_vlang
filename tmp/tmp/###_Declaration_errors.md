### Declaration errors

In development mode the compiler will warn you that you haven't used the variable
(you'll get an "unused variable" warning).
In production mode (enabled by passing the `-prod` flag to v â€“ `v -prod foo.v`)
it will not compile at all (like in Go).

```v failcompile nofmt
fn main() {
	a := 10
	if true {
		a := 20 // error: redefinition of `a`
	}
	// warning: unused variable `a`
}
```

Unlike most languages, variable shadowing is not allowed. Declaring a variable with a name
that is already used in a parent scope will cause a compilation error.

You can shadow imported modules though, as it is very useful in some situations:
```v ignore
import ui
import gg

fn draw(ctx &gg.Context) {
	gg := ctx.parent.get_ui().gg
	gg.draw_rect(10, 10, 100, 50)
}
```
