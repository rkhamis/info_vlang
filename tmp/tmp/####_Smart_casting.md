#### Smart casting

```v oksyntax
if w is Mars {
	assert typeof(w).name == 'Mars'
	if w.dust_storm() {
		println('bad weather!')
	}
}
```
`w` has type `Mars` inside the body of the `if` statement. This is
known as *flow-sensitive typing*.
If `w` is a mutable identifier, it would be unsafe if the compiler smart casts it without a warning.
That's why you have to declare a `mut` before the `is` expression:

```v ignore
if mut w is Mars {
	assert typeof(w).name == 'Mars'
	if w.dust_storm() {
		println('bad weather!')
	}
}
```
Otherwise `w` would keep its original type.
> This works for both, simple variables and complex expressions like `user.name`
