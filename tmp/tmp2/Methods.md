## Methods

```v
struct User {
	age int
}

fn (u User) can_register() bool {
	return u.age > 16
}

user := User{
	age: 10
}
println(user.can_register()) // "false"
user2 := User{
	age: 20
}
println(user2.can_register()) // "true"
```

V doesn't have classes, but you can define methods on types.
A method is a function with a special receiver argument.
The receiver appears in its own argument list between the `fn` keyword and the method name.
Methods must be in the same module as the receiver type.

In this example, the `can_register` method has a receiver of type `User` named `u`.
The convention is not to use receiver names like `self` or `this`,
but a short, preferably one letter long, name.
