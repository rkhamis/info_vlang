### Spawning Concurrent Tasks
V's model of concurrency is very similar to Go's. To run `foo()` concurrently in
a different thread, just call it with `go foo()`:

```v
import math

fn p(a f64, b f64) { // ordinary function without return value
	c := math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
	println(c)
}

fn main() {
	go p(3, 4)
	// p will be run in parallel thread
}
```

Sometimes it is necessary to wait until a parallel thread has finished. This can
be done by assigning a *handle* to the started thread and calling the `wait()` method
to this handle later:

```v
import math

fn p(a f64, b f64) { // ordinary function without return value
	c := math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
	println(c) // prints `5`
}

fn main() {
	h := go p(3, 4)
	// p() runs in parallel thread
	h.wait()
	// p() has definitely finished
}
```

This approach can also be used to get a return value from a function that is run in a
parallel thread. There is no need to modify the function itself to be able to call it
concurrently.

```v
import math { sqrt }

fn get_hypot(a f64, b f64) f64 { //       ordinary function returning a value
	c := sqrt(a * a + b * b)
	return c
}

fn main() {
	g := go get_hypot(54.06, 2.08) // spawn thread and get handle to it
	h1 := get_hypot(2.32, 16.74) //   do some other calculation here
	h2 := g.wait() //                 get result from spawned thread
	println('Results: $h1, $h2') //   prints `Results: 16.9, 54.1`
}
```

If there is a large number of tasks, it might be easier to manage them
using an array of threads.

```v
import time

fn task(id int, duration int) {
	println('task $id begin')
	time.sleep(duration * time.millisecond)
	println('task $id end')
}

fn main() {
	mut threads := []thread{}
	threads << go task(1, 500)
	threads << go task(2, 900)
	threads << go task(3, 100)
	threads.wait()
	println('done')
}

// Output:
// task 1 begin
// task 2 begin
// task 3 begin
// task 3 end
// task 1 end
// task 2 end
// done
```

Additionally for threads that return the same type, calling `wait()`
on the thread array will return all computed values.

```v
fn expensive_computing(i int) int {
	return i * i
}

fn main() {
	mut threads := []thread int{}
	for i in 1 .. 10 {
		threads << go expensive_computing(i)
	}
	// Join all tasks
	r := threads.wait()
	println('All jobs finished: $r')
}

// Output: All jobs finished: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```
