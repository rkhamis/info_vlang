#### Special Channel Features

For special purposes there are some builtin properties and methods:
```v
struct Abc {
	x int
}

a := 2.13
ch := chan f64{}
res := ch.try_push(a) // try to perform `ch <- a`
println(res)
l := ch.len // number of elements in queue
c := ch.cap // maximum queue length
is_closed := ch.closed // bool flag - has `ch` been closed
println(l)
println(c)
mut b := Abc{}
ch2 := chan Abc{}
res2 := ch2.try_pop(mut b) // try to perform `b = <-ch2`
```

The `try_push/pop()` methods will return immediately with one of the results
`.success`, `.not_ready` or `.closed` - dependent on whether the object has been transferred or
the reason why not.
Usage of these methods and properties in production is not recommended -
algorithms based on them are often subject to race conditions. Especially `.len` and
`.closed` should not be used to make decisions.
Use `or` branches, error propagation or `select` instead (see [Syntax and Usage](#syntax-and-usage)
and [Channel Select](#channel-select) above).
