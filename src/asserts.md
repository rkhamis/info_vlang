### Asserts

```v
fn foo(mut v []int) {
	v[0] = 1
}

mut v := [20]
foo(mut v)
assert v[0] < 4
```
An `assert` statement checks that its expression evaluates to `true`. If an assert fails,
the program will abort. Asserts should only be used to detect programming errors. When an
assert fails it is reported to *stderr*, and the values on each side of a comparison operator
(such as `<`, `==`) will be printed when possible. This is useful to easily find an
unexpected value. Assert statements can be used in any function.
