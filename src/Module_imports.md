## Module imports

For information about creating a module, see [Modules](#modules).

Modules can be imported using the `import` keyword:

```v
import os

fn main() {
	// read text from stdin
	name := os.input('Enter your name: ')
	println('Hello, $name!')
}
```
This program can use any public definitions from the `os` module, such
as the `input` function. See the [standard library](https://modules.vlang.io/)
documentation for a list of common modules and their public symbols.

By default, you have to specify the module prefix every time you call an external function.
This may seem verbose at first, but it makes code much more readable
and easier to understand - it's always clear which function from
which module is being called. This is especially useful in large code bases.

Cyclic module imports are not allowed, like in Go.
