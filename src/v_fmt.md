### v fmt

You don't need to worry about formatting your code or setting style guidelines.
`v fmt` takes care of that:

```shell
v fmt file.v
```

It's recommended to set up your editor, so that `v fmt -w` runs on every save.
A vfmt run is usually pretty cheap (takes <30ms).

Always run `v fmt -w file.v` before pushing your code.
