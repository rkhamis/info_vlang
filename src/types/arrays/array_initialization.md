#### Array Initialization
The basic initialization syntax is as described [above](#basic-array-concepts).
The type of an array is determined by the first element:
* `[1, 2, 3]` is an array of ints (`[]int`).
* `['a', 'b']` is an array of strings (`[]string`).

The user can explicitly specify the type for the first element: `[byte(16), 32, 64, 128]`.
V arrays are homogeneous (all elements must have the same type).
This means that code like `[1, 'a']` will not compile.

The above syntax is fine for a small number of known elements but for very large or empty
arrays there is a second initialization syntax:
```v
mut a := []int{len: 10000, cap: 30000, init: 3}
```
This creates an array of 10000 `int` elements that are all initialized with `3`. Memory
space is reserved for 30000 elements. The parameters `len`, `cap` and `init` are optional;
`len` defaults to `0` and `init` to the default initialization of the element type (`0`
for numerical type, `''` for `string`, etc). The run time system makes sure that the
capacity is not smaller than `len` (even if a smaller value is specified explicitly):

```v
arr := []int{len: 5, init: -1}
// `arr == [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, arr.cap == 5

// Declare an empty array:
users := []int{}
```


Setting the capacity improves performance of pushing elements to the array
as reallocations can be avoided:

```v
mut numbers := []int{cap: 1000}
println(numbers.len) // 0
// Now appending elements won't reallocate
for i in 0 .. 1000 {
	numbers << i
}
```
Note: The above code uses a [range `for`](#range-for) statement and a
[push operator (`<<`)](#array-operations).
