### Initialization vs assignment

Note the (important) difference between `:=` and `=`.
`:=` is used for declaring and initializing, `=` is used for assigning.

```v failcompile
fn main() {
	age = 21
}
```

This code will not compile, because the variable `age` is not declared.
All variables need to be declared in V.

```v
fn main() {
	age := 21
}
```

The values of multiple variables can be changed in one line.
In this way, their values can be swapped without an intermediary variable.

```v
mut a := 0
mut b := 1
println('$a, $b') // 0, 1
a, b = b, a
println('$a, $b') // 1, 0
```
