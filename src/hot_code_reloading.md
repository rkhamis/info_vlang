## Hot code reloading

```v live
module main

import time
import os

[live]
fn print_message() {
	println('Hello! Modify this message while the program is running.')
}

fn main() {
	for {
		print_message()
		time.sleep(500 * time.millisecond)
	}
}
```

Build this example with `v -live message.v`.

Functions that you want to be reloaded must have `[live]` attribute
before their definition.

Right now it's not possible to modify types while the program is running.
